# Use cases

## You can use Metrics Server for:

* CPU/Memory based horizontal autoscaling (learn more about Horizontal Autoscaling)
* Automatically adjusting/suggesting resources needed by containers (learn more about Vertical Autoscaling)

## Don't use Metrics Server when you need:

* Non-Kubernetes clusters
* An accurate source of resource usage metrics
* Horizontal autoscaling based on other resources than CPU/Memory

## For unsupported use cases, check out full monitoring solutions like Prometheus.
